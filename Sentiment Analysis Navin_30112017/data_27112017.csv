A major frustration I have is that Word slows to a crawl when I use these features, particularly on a longer document (20 pages or more), which I must do frequently.  This is especially a problem on my Surface, which appears almost incapable of running Office 365 when I am in tracked editing mode.  But it is also a problem when I am on my more powerful PC Desktop.  I have gone to Microsoft support community chat rooms and independent ones, and they all say the same thing - most machines can't handle the tracked editing mode on longer documents and the best solution is to simply turn it off.  Very, very frustrating.  It would be great if you could improve MS Word so that it will run smoothly on our machines.  Thanx.",0.26902

R_OwFkvxZRiIG2MDf,8/23/2017 0:00,8/23/2017 0:00,34,1,"We were trying to make changes to a domain name that was purchased through Office 365, and we were told that we would not be able to transfer the domain name away because it was owned by GoDaddy. They stated that Microsoft Office 365 has a partnership with GoDaddy when it comes to users purchasing domain names through the Office 365 service. They stated that in order for us to transfer the domain (away from Office 365) we needed to cancel the domain through Office 365, wait for it to go back into the public pool for re-purchase, and then purchase through GoDaddy because GoDaddy owns the domain.\\I was shocked to hear this, as it seemed incredibly inconvenient, especially when you've been emailing clients, are already in the process of building a website, and are using it in marketing.\\I went on to tell the tech support agent that I found this Microsoft article that tells you how to transfer domain names away:\https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Domains-FAQ-1272bad0-4bd4-4796-8005-67d6fb3afc5a#bkmk_canitransfermydomainawayfromoffice365toanotherprovider\\He seemed very surprised about this and stated that this was new to him, and that the ability to transfer domains away was just implemented in July.\\The tech support we had was Gurpreet Singh and we were Office 365 Ticket #30126-6185289.\\Later on, we talked to a brand new person and they told us that domain name transferring was definitely possible and that it was simple to do. They stated that it would take ""3 hours"" to transfer the domain name away to a new registrar. I was surprised at this statement, as it typically takes 5-7 days for a domain name to completely transfer UNLESS the domain name being transferred was going to the same registrar. I stated this to the tech support member, and he stated that he was absolutely positive it would take 3 hours. As of today, we are still waiting for the domain to completely transfer away from Office 365 and we are on Day 6.\\With all that to state, this is why I'm giving a ""1, Not all likely"" because I don't have a lot of confidence in the tech support team at Office 365. I don't believe their staff is trained properly, nor do I believe Office 365 has it together when it comes to releasing updates and ensuring their staff gets wind of it. I also don't feel confident that Office 365 can handle domain names properly. It was odd hearing a tech support agent state that the domain name was owned by GoDaddy, and when I did a whois.net search on the domain, it came up as Wild West Domains. I would have thought that the registrar name would have been Office 365 or even GoDaddy (as the tech support member stated). \\Neverthless, I hope Office 365 can do better in the future. I like all the other things that Office 365 has to offer, but I definitely would never recommend purchasing domain names through Office 365. I highly dislike that you cannot modify the Nameservers, that you can only add DNS records, and that their tech support team does not seem to know what they are doing.",3.65401
